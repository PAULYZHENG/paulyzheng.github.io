Iâ€˜m now a senior student at Harbin Insitute of Technology, Weihai and my major is software engineering. My work focuses on the research of geometric modeling and computer aided geometric design. In particular, I am interested in developable surface construction. And I also have a strong interest in micro-expression recognition and analysis in 3D scene.

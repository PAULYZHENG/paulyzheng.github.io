<B>Short Bio</B><br/>
Iâ€˜m now a senior student at Harbin Insitute of Technology, Weihai. My major is software engineering. And my work focuses on the research of geometric modeling and computer aided design. In particular, I am interested in developable surface construction. And I also have a strong interest in 3D reconstruction and printing.

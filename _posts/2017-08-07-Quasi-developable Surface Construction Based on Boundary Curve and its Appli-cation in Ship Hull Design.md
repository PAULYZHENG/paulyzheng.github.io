__Abstract:__ A novel method is proposed for quasi-developable surface construction between two boundary curves. Different from existing methods which construct a developable surface by connecting finite sampling points of two curves, the present method allows continuous mapping between boundary curves, which enhances the ability of search-ing for better developable surface. This method directly generates a developable B-spline surface whose bounda-ries interpolate target profile curves, as a contrast to existing approaches which construct smooth developable surfaces by joining surface patches. Moreover, with the present method, it is easy to control the overall smooth-ness of surface and avoid emergence of regression curves inside concerned surface region. The method is applied to several ship hull data and quasi-developable surfaces which meet manufacturing requirements are success-fully generated.

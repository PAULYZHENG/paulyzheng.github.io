Abstract: In this paper, an important surface modeling problem in ship hull design is studied. Given two ad-jacent profile curves, a quasi-developable surface with given curves as boundary is constructed. Different from existing methods which construct a developable surface connecting finite sampling points of two curves, our method allows continuous change of parameter mapping between boundary curves. The ability of searching for better developable surfaces is therefore enhanced. This method directly generates a developa-ble B-spline surface whose boundaries interpolate target profile curves, as a contrast to existing approaches which construct smooth developable surfaces by smoothly joining surface patches. Moreover, with the pre-sent method, it is easy to control the overall smoothness of surface and avoid the appearance of regression curves inside concerned surface region. The present method is applied to several hull data and qua-si-developable surfaces which meet actual manufacturing requirements are generated.

我是一朵不起眼的墨西哥蓝鸟, 一种公认的生命力顽强且易养殖的多肉植物. 

I am an unattractive Mexico blue bird, a kind of succulent which is vigorous and easy to plant.

我由经验老道的花农栽培, 安稳度过了稚嫩的幼苗期. 

I was sowed by an experienced flower grower and got through the immature seedling period safely.

我被摆在大街上售卖. 有人远远的观赏我, 有人端起我细细怜悯, 有人只看了我一眼却把我买回了家. 

When I was placed on the street for sale, someone admired me from afar, someone took me and had pity on me, but there was a person who bought me home after just taking a look at me.

我被精心呵护, 渐渐长满了整个花盆. 

I took the whole flowerpot gradually with great care.

这狭小的空间限制了我自由、纵情的生长. 我即将被移栽, 去一个更大的地方. 满心期待.

The narrow space restricted my free and unbridled growth. I will be transplanted and live in a larger home. I was full of anticipation.

金秋时节, 我经过复杂的工序, 被移到了约两倍大的新家. 

In the autumn, I was moved to a new home about two times larger after a complicated process.

由于移栽时根部受损, 我开始枯萎. 但我仍然被按时浇水.

I began to wither because my roots were damaged when transplanting. But I was still watered on time.

There is a miracle, when you believe. 枯萎的花盘上钻出了新的花朵.

Now.

如果当时我被移栽成功, 现在我将会拥有一朵占满新花盆的硕大无比的花. 在下一个秋天继续被移栽.

If I were transplanted successfully at that time, now I may take all space of the new flowerpot. Maybe I will be transplanted again in the next autumn.

虽然经历了枯萎, 但我现在开了许多小花. 我的未来充满了无限种可能, 而不仅仅是在真正的死亡来临之前，轮回于占满花盆和移栽之间.

Although I have suffered withering, I get many small flowers now. My future is full of possibilities, not just cycling between occupying pots and transplanting before the real death coming.

经历了许多变数, 我又一次占满了花盆. 虽然仍然需要被移栽, 但我相信我的生活将会更加丰富多彩.

I have already taken all space of the current flowerpot. Although transplant is still needed, I believe my life will be more colorful.

我把这盆花留在了工作了三年的实验室.

This flower has been given to Xiaoqian as a gift when I left Weihai.

故事就暂时到这里了.

End of story.
